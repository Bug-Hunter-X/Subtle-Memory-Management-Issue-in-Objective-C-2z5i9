The problem likely lies in how `myString` is handled. If `myObject` is released,  `myString` which is a strong reference, will also be released.  However, if `myObject` isn't properly released, `myString` is also not released. This can lead to leaks.

The solution is to ensure that all objects are properly deallocated when they are no longer needed. The `dealloc` method is not needed anymore if ARC is being used.  If you are not using ARC you must manually handle the retain/release cycles.

If ARC is enabled (the default in modern Xcode projects) there is no need for manual memory management. The compiler will handle retain counts for you. However, even with ARC, understanding how strong and weak references work remains critical to avoiding memory issues.

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
// dealloc method is not needed in ARC
@end

// ... in some method ...
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
myObject.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@
